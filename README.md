What is blame calculus

Notice
------
Because the model for overloaded functions needs to be updated, generating wrappers for overloaded functions is slightly buggy.

TODO
----
1. Add *useful* information to this Readme
2. Give pointers on compiling node with harmony flags on by default
3. Fix stuff:
    - Fix the model for overloaded functions
4. Find a *better* way of integrating with karma -- the current way is sufficient for small projects, but for larger projects it might be troublesome.
